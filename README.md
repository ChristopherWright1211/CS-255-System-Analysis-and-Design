Reflection 

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? 

The client, DriverPass, requested a web-based system that would allow students to schedule in-car driving lessons, take online practice tests, and track their progress. The system also needed to support instructors and administrators for lesson management, user management, and secure payment processing. 

What did you do particularly well? 

I did particularly well in creating clear UML diagrams that illustrated the interactions between users and the system. My activity and sequence diagrams captured different user paths, including alternative flows for errors such as payment failures or scheduling conflicts. This helped ensure that the design accounted for real-world conditions. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

I will revise the class diagram. While it effectively modeled core entities, I would improve it by refining attribute details (such as data types) and expanding relationships to cover additional constraints. This would make the model more implementation-ready for developers. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

I interpreted the client’s needs by first capturing them as functional and non-functional requirements. For example, functional requirements included lesson scheduling and practice tests, while non-functional requirements emphasized security, accessibility, and scalability. These needs were then mapped into diagrams and technical requirements in the design document. 

Considering user needs is critical because software that does not align with user expectations fails in adoption and usability. Designing with the user in mind ensures that the system is intuitive, efficient, and solves the client’s actual problems.  

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? 

I approach software design by starting with requirements gathering, then moving into UML modeling to visualize use cases, activities, sequences, and class structures. In the future, I would expand this by using Agile methods such as iterative prototyping and user feedback loops. This would allow me to validate design decisions earlier and adapt quickly to changing requirements.
